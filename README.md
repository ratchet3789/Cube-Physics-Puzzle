# Cube Physics Puzzle
### What is this?
Cube Physics Puzzle is a simple Unity example project I created to teach the basics of mouse position raycasting, object deletion and physics based movement.

### __Can I modify and sell this?
No. The __by-nc-sa 4.0__ licence has been specifically chosen to stop this. You can however use it to create your own game to then give-away, but if you do please reference this Git repo and contact me as I would like to play it.
